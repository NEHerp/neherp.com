The Lacey Act is the current statute that is used to prevent the importation or spread of potentially dangerous non-native species. On September 21, 2006, USFWS (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) received a petition from the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) requesting that Burmese pythons be considered for inclusion in the injurious wildlife regulations pursuant to the Lacey Act (18 U.S.C. 42). The USFWS  began an Injurious Wildlife Species Review Regarding Python, Boa and Eunectes Species Of Snakes in early 2008.  A Notice of Inquiry was published inviting public comment.  NEHS submitted a letter in response to that inquiry.

This page is an index of information collected from all sides of the discussion.  Information sources are provided to aid in putting the information in context.   I encourage everyone to educate yourself on these issues, and act accordingly.
