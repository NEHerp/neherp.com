The following information is exerpted from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife website (<http://www.maine.gov/ifw/wildlife/species/unrestricted_species.htm>). Please note that only reptile & amphibian information has been provided. Please refer to the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife site for the full regulation text.

### Unrestrited Reptile & Amphibian Species

**Listed Species:** The following species of reptiles and amphibians do not require an importation permit, **and can be traded by commercial pet shops**, pursuant to Title 12 MRSA 7237, and 7377 and Regulations Chapter 2.3 and 7.60: “Acceptable species of tropical fish and wildlife that may be imported without an importation permit shall be designated by the Commissioner, a list of which shall be maintained and made available by the Department. The acceptability of such species to be imported or possessed shall be based on an informed determination by the Commissioner that the species will not cause an unreasonable risk to indigenous species, or their habitats, or pose other dangers to the natural community, in captivity or if accidentally or intentionally released into the wild.”

**Reminder:** A Wildlife or Fish Importation permit is STILL required for any species that is not listed herein as Unrestricted by the Commissioner. The list is updated annually on January 1st. Please check for species that may be added or deleted from the list.

**Added this year:** Degu- Octodon degu

**Addition of Species:** Any species can be considered for addition to this list by submitting a request with sufficient documentation to the Warden Service Permit Office by September for the next annual publication.

**Captive Breeding:** The Department is moving towards a requirement that all stock for pet shops be captive bred. If a listed species is not available as captive bred, an exception can be considered if requested (see heading “Addition of Species” above). This is necessary because of high tick loads and health issues, and other considerations in many wild caught specimens.

**Maine Law prohibits the commercial trading of native Maine snakes and turtles taken from the wild.**

**Endangered Species - Animal Welfare:**

Importers of wildlife must comply with CITES and Endangered and Threatened Species Regulations, and with State and Federal Animal Welfare laws. Under Maine law, in addition to Maine Warden Service, the Department of Agriculture Pet Shop Inspector may enforce Fish and Wildlife laws (Title 12 MRSA) relating to wildlife importation.

**Species Identification:** Because of the variety of common names in use, the latin scientific name of all wildlife and fish species sold in pet shops must be designated and readily available at inspection. They are listed here by common name first.

**Questions regarding domestic animals, or about the pet shop license itself, should be addressed to the Department of Agriculture, Food & Rural Resources, Division of Regulations, Animal Welfare Unit, Station #28, Augusta, ME 04333. (207) 287-3846.**

**Questions regarding the importation of fish or wildlife, and about the unrestricted species list for importing wildlife, should be addressed to Warden Service, 284 State Street, 41 State House Station, Augusta, ME 04333-0041. (207) 287-5240.**
