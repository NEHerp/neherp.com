Massachusetts Restricted Herptiles List
In 1995, Massachusetts revised its list of those reptiles and amphibians that require a permit to possess in captivity. This revision is the first since the list was written in the 1970's, with the help of the Massachusetts Herpetological Society. The New England Herpetological Society was instrumental in the revision of the list - many animals commonly captive bred were removed from the list (for example, Bearded Dragons and Leopard Tortoises).

The lists available below are a combination of the new Permits List and the Massachusetts list of endangered, threatened, or special concern species (which only deals with species native to Massachusetts). Other animals that also require a permit are those that are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and those species listed in the Red Book of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). For example, although not listed here, Galapagos tortoises would require a state permit.

Permit applications can be obtained from the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife at 100 Cambridge Street, Leverett Saltonstall Building, Room 1902, Boston, MA 02202. Their telephone number is (617) 727-3151. Two types of permits are available: a permit to possess a single animal, and a permit for multiple animals (necessary for captive breeding). Permits are renewed on a yearly basis, for a small fee (per permit, not per animal). Permits are relatively easy to obtain for animals that are captive-bred (if they aren't already exempt) except in the case of venomous species. For rare, imported, or endangered animals, permits are issued on a case-by-case basis; if you want to work with an endangered species for example, it helps if you have a lot of experience with related, non-threatened, species. A number of members of the New England Herpetological Society possess permits for many different animals. Ask around at a meeting for more information if you are interested.

The revised regulations were circulated to Massachusetts pet stores in August of 1995. To read the cover letter that accompanied the regulations, click here.
