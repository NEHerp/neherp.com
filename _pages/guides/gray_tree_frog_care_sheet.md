*Hyla veriscolor*

##### Description:

Light green to gray colored frogs which change colors to match the background. Medium sized frogs, these frogs have a polkadot under each eye and have big toepads that help them climb.

##### Habitat:

These frogs are fairly common throughout parts of the US. They often hang out in brushy, overgrown areas, so probably a half and half or terrarium tank would be best for pet care.

##### Diet:

These guys eat the usual insect diet. Crickets, moths, flies, etc. A vitamin supplement powder should be used at least once a week.

##### Habits:

You can usually tell the males from the females since they are the ones who sing "love songs" to attract females to their "pad". Males start singing, usually at night when air temperatures reach around 60 degrees. (April through July is breeding season) Their songs are like birds or buzzing trills.
