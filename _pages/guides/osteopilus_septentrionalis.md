#### Description:

These are the largest tree frog in North America! -- varying in color from dark green to pale gray. Will change color to match environment. May have spots that sometimes disappear (depending on environment).

#### Habitat:

A half and half tank or a terrarium with a small dish with a small amount of (clean) water is necessary (these frogs do not like to swim too much-they only use the water to hydrate their skin). Lot's of places to hide are a necessity-moss is definitely recommended. The temperature in the enclosure should not go much below 70° degrees unless you are prepared for hibernation, something which is not advised unless you are an experienced frog-keeper with access to all temperature information for your specific species, and know how to construct a hydration chamber.

#### Diet:

Crickets are a main source of nutrition. Cubans can have a huge appetite. The females eat a lot more than the males. In the warmer months they eat many more crickets than during the colder months.

#### Habits:

These frogs are noisy. They bark often usually at odd hours of the morning (i.e.; 3 AM). They sound like little dogs. Cubans are a very hearty inexpensive species.

#### Miscellaneous Facts:

These frogs are notorious for cannibalism...if there are other species of frogs in the tank, or even specimens of the same species, Cuban tree frogs have been known to feast on their neighbors! Remember, a frog doesn't need to be bigger to eat another frog, just hungry! Also, you should always wash your hands after handling any frog or toad, but especially Cubans. Some people can have really strong reactions to skin secretions (especially if you rub your eye after handling the frogs!!)
