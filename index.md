Welcome
=======

The New England Herpetological Society is a group of reptile and amphibian enthusiasts. Our goals are education, conservation and the advancement of herpetology. Society members have unique opportunities to further their knowledge of and participation in all aspects of herpetology.


Originally known as the Massachusetts Herpetological Society, it was founded in 1972. As the membership base began to expand beyond the borders of Massachusetts, we changed our name to the New England Herpetological Society.


The New England Herpetological Society is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Donations are 100% tax deductible.


Our goals:

  - To promote the discovery and dissemination of amphibian and reptile information.
  - To encourage the specific study of amphibians and reptiles.
  - To encourage the conservation of amphibians and reptiles, as well as wildlife in general.
  - To stimulate fellowship among herpetologists and herp enthusiasts throughout New England.

 

***Announcement:*** On January 3, 2014 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts changed the Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR's) to reflect the de-regulation of the following species of reptiles that are now legal to keep, breed, sell and trade in Massachusetts without a permit requirement.

- Emerald tree boa  -      Corallus caninus
- Green tree python -      Morelia viridis
- The Family Chamaeleonidae (all Chameleons)
- Spiny-tailed monitor lizard - Varanus acanthurus

Experience the joy of reptiles! Whether you are already a reptile enthusiast, fascinated by these exotic creatures or just a little bit curious, you are welcome to join us at one of our monthly meetings. With so few reptile organizations in the New England area, our meetings provide an opportunity for people of all ages to learn, touch and observe all kinds of amphibians and reptiles. In addition, meetings provide the means to adopt or purchase reptiles and amphibians such as snakes, frogs, turtles, toads, lizards and much more.

The Society meets monthly at the New England Wildlife Center in Weymouth, Massachusetts. For details, click on the [Meetings page](/meetings/).
